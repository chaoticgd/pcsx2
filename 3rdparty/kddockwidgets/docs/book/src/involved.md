# Get Involved

## Bug Reporting

Please submit your issue reports to our [GitHub space](https://github.com/KDAB/KDDockWidgets/issues).

When reporting bugs please make it easy for the maintainer to reproduce it. Use `examples/minimal/`
or `examples/dockwidgets/` for reproducing the problem. If you did modifications to the example
in order to reproduce then please attach the *patch* and not a picture of your changes. You can
get a patch by doing `git diff > repro.diff` at the repo root.

Also state which KDDW sha1, branch or version you're using, and which operating system.

Cosmetic bugs only reproducible on Qt5 or old operating systems will have lower priority. Please test
on newer versions before reporting.
