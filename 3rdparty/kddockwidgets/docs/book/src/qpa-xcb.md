`KDDockWidgets` is developed and tested under `KWin`. Many other window managers also work, but they are less tested.<br>
Please report a bug if you use a popular window manager and it's not working correctly.

Note: Not all features will work across all window managers. `Flag_NativeTitleBar` for example doesn't work with `KWin`, as this
window manager doesn't send any mouse event to KDDW.
